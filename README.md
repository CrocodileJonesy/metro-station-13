### GETTING THE CODE
The simplest way to obtain the code is using the github .zip feature.
The recommended way is to download our most recent releases, as they are confirmed to be stable and compiling.

Compiling, running and administrating the code is unsupported by official staff of this project. If you're unfamiliar with this process, you're ill-advised to undertake this process.
